An Introduction to Computational Statistics in Python
====

This workshop was given the [Data Institute's 2019 Conference](https://www.sfdatainstitute.org/).

It will provide a hands-on introduction to computational statistics. The focus will be on the efficient simulation of probabilities and statistics, for example the outcomes of dice rolling or the results of an A/B test. 

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to apply bootstrapping and permutation testing to solve applied Data Science problems.

A working knowledge of Python (e.g., create variables and functions) is required. There are no math, probability, or statistics prerequisites. 

You'll be writing code during the workshop so please bring a laptop. All other materials and resources will be provided.

Software
----

We'll be using Jupyter Notebook to run the code. If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebook, please check out a video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk).

There are 3 ways to run the code in this repo:

1. Launch Colab in your browser: [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brianspiering/ComputationalStatistics/blob/master/1_welcome.ipynb)
1. Launch Binder in your browser: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/brianspiering/ComputationalStatistics/master)
1. Download and run locally
